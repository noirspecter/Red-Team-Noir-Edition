# Red Team: Noir Edition – Entry 002

> **Case File:** AlphaFin Internal Breach Simulation  
> **Operator:** NoirSpecter  
> **Objective:** Simulate an internal attacker targeting a fictional fintech company to achieve domain admin and access financial records using eJPT-level tools only.

---

## 🧠 Executive Summary
This simulated internal penetration test targeted **AlphaFin**, a fictional fintech company. The assessment started from a compromised employee workstation (via phishing) and resulted in:

- Full **Domain Admin** compromise
- Access to sensitive financial records
- Exploitation of weak credentials, misconfigurations, and lateral movement paths

All attacks were executed using beginner-level tools aligned with the eJPT toolkit (e.g., Nmap, Hydra, Metasploit, Cadaver).

## 🗺️ Attack Flow Diagram

![Attack Flow](images/attack-flow-entry002.png)

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- `Nmap` – Recon & Port Scanning
- `Hydra` – Credential Brute Force
- `Metasploit Framework` – Exploitation, Reverse Shells, Post-Exploitation
- `Cadaver` – WebDAV File Upload
- Native Windows/Linux command-line tools

---

## 🕵 Initial Access
**Method:** Spear phishing email with a malicious macro payload  
**Payload:** Meterpreter reverse shell (generated via `msfvenom`)  
**Result:** Remote shell as standard domain user on workstation `AlphaFin-WKS-23`

---

## 🌐 Internal Reconnaissance
**Tool:** Nmap + manual enumeration  
**Findings:**
- Web server (10.0.20.5) with `/webdav` directory (HTTP 401)
- File server with SMB shares
- Domain Controller (10.0.30.1)

---

## 📁 Exploitation: WebDAV Service
**Vuln:** Weak credentials (`itadmin:Password123`) brute-forced via Hydra  
**Action:** Uploaded PHP webshell via `cadaver` to `/webdav`  
**Result:** Reverse shell access to internal web server

---

## 🔐 Privilege Escalation & Lateral Movement
**On Web Server (Ubuntu):**
- Privilege escalation via misconfigured `sudo` permissions
- Extracted IT admin SSH key + cached Domain Admin creds

**To Domain Controller:**
- Used `psexec` with captured credentials to gain SYSTEM shell
- Dumped domain hashes and confirmed Domain Admin access

---

## 🧾 Data Access
**Target Data:**
- `\\10.0.20.10\Finance_Data` share
- SQL Server with `Transactions` table

**Data Types:** Customer names, account numbers, credit card last4, transaction amounts  
**Impact:** Demonstrated full access to AlphaFin’s financial crown jewels

---

## 🛡️ Recommendations (Abbreviated)
- Enforce MFA for all admin accounts
- Implement strict network segmentation
- Patch internal services, especially WebDAV
- Use strong, unique credentials for all accounts
- Disable admin credential reuse & caching
- Deploy internal monitoring & SIEM alerting

---

## 🧪 Lab Mapping (TryHackMe)
To replicate parts of this scenario:
- **"Dav"** – WebDAV exploitation
- **"Blue"** / **"Ignite"** – Initial foothold via known vulnerabilities
- **"Attacktive Directory"** – Post-exploitation in an AD environment
